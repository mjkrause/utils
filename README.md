## Argon

This is a bit complicated as you need two tokens, one to download the BDBag, and a second to download the data files (CRAM, CRAI).

### Preparation
Create a JSON file like so
```JSON
{
  "personal_UUID": "",
  "scope_bdbag": "",
  "scope_results": "",
  "token_bdbag": "",
  "token_results": ""
}
```
